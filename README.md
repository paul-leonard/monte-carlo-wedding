# monte-carlo-wedding
A Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the distribution of attendants to a wedding using Python, NumPy, and pandas.


## Release Info
**Author**: Paul Leonard
**Version**: 0.1.0


## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a way for users to estimate a distribution of attendees to a wedding or other event.  Using accurate attendance estimates and ranges are key to planning successful events.


## Architecture
Input is provided to the Jupyter Notebook through a user-supplied CSV file containing a list of guest parties invited to a wedding, including their guest count and the probability of each party attending the event.  The CSV is consumed into a pandas dataframe and then Monte Carlo simulations are run for the selected number of simulations.  Each simulation uses NumPy's random method and the user-supplied party's probability to determine if each guest party attends the event or not.  A resulting histogram of total wedding attendance is then displayed showing the distribution of attendees to be expected at the wedding.


## Future Features
- calculate typical percentage of invitees attending
- refine bins
- add labels
- make a guest option where any party size of 1 automatically increases to 2


## Change Log
**0.1.0** 9-22-2021 - Initial creation
**0.2.0** 9-22-2021 - Monte Carlo Analysis runs 1000 simulations and displays histogram
